# COMP3850 - Pace: Computing Industry Project

**Overview**

This PACE unit draws together learning in previous units to prepare students for the workplace through engaging with a partner organisation. Students will work in close collaboration throughout the session with a community-based project sponsor that has provided the specifications for the work that needs to be completed. Students will work in self-managed teams to first understand the problem or opportunity identified the partner and then develop a project plan and scoping or requirements document. Students will create appropriate designs to solve a given problem, potentially delivering a software product or other outputs as needed by the sponsor. All projects will involve the development of supporting project documentation. The project requires an equal focus on process and the product, requiring the use of quality control and assurance methods, tools and techniques.
