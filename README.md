# COMP3850 - Pace: Computing Industry Project

**Unit Overview**
----

This PACE unit draws together learning in previous units to prepare students for the workplace through engaging with a partner organisation. Students will work in close collaboration throughout the session with a community-based project sponsor that has provided the specifications for the work that needs to be completed. Students will work in self-managed teams to first understand the problem or opportunity identified by the partner and then develop a project plan and scoping or requirements document. Students will create appropriate designs to solve a given problem, potentially delivering a software product or other outputs as needed by the sponsor. All projects will involve the development of supporting project documentation. The project requires an equal focus on process and the product, requiring the use of quality control and assurance methods, tools, and techniques.

**Project Type:** Data Analysis and Reporting

**About:**

I had the privilege of collaborating with four other talented students as part of Macquarie University's Professional and Community Engagement (PACE) program. Together, we partnered with SAS Institute Australia to investigate the work of their affiliated organisation, Zoe Empowers.

Zoe Empowers is a charitable organisation that helps empower vulnerable children and youth-led families with solutions to overcome extreme poverty and achieve self-sufficiency. To assess the success of their program, our team was asked by SAS Institute Australia to leverage data analytics methods and tools, such as SAS Viya (SAS Institute Australia's specialized software) and Python, to extract key insights regarding the program and its participants' engagement/success before, during, and after the program. Our primary objective was not to deliver any solutions to SAS Institute Australia regarding any aspects of the Zoe Empowers program. Furthermore, we did not engage in projecting future data outcomes but instead focused on analysing the current efforts of the program and how they can be improved for future intakes.

The project entailed the development of three reports: "Findings," "Analysis," and "Recommendations," with detailed descriptions of each available in the Project Delivery section. The concluding phase of our project required our team to showcase a presentation to SAS Institute Australia at the PACE Presentation Night. Our presentation outlined the problem being addressed, what we did to address the problem, and how we went about coming up with solutions. Furthermore, our team highlighted significant insights extracted from the three reports, delving into various facets of the Zoe Empowers program that could benefit from improvements to enhance its overall success. The excellence of our project left such an impression on SAS Institute Australia that they invited us to celebrate and share our presentation with the wider team at the SAS Lane Cove office.

**Project Phases**

1. **Feasibility Study:** A Feasibility Report to understand the business problem and consider solutions.
2. **Project Plan & Scoping/Requirements Document:** Project Plan and Software Requirements Specification or Project Scoping Document.
3. **Increment 1:** Updated Deliverable 2, Design and Testing Document, Prototype development, and demonstration.
4. **Increment 2:** Updated Deliverable 3 and demonstration to the client.
5. **Project Presentation:** We presented our project, including the problem being addressed, solution proposed, methods, and technology used.
6. **Final Reflective Report:** This report reviews the semester and all project goals, activities, and outcomes.
7. **Delivery of Product to Sponsor:** Delivery of Final Product (e.g., Findings, Analysis, Recommendations Report, as well as the Presentation Slides) as agreed with the Sponsor.

**Project Delivery**

- Reports:

  - **Findings:** The Findings Report provides detailed data visualizations and an exploration of the raw data.
  - **Analysis:** The Analysis Report identifies any vulnerabilities/gaps that may exist within the program's structure and activities, based on key information derived from the Findings Report.
  - **Recommendations:** The Recommendations Report provides suggestions for improving the effectiveness of the program based on the vulnerabilities/gaps identified in the Analysis Report.

- Final Presentation:

  - **Presentation:** On June 1st, 2023, we showcased our project in a lecture theater to other groups, their sponsors, SAS Institute Australia, and the marker. Our presentation outlined the problem being addressed, what we did to address the problem, and how we went about coming up with solutions. Furthermore, our team highlighted significant insights extracted from the three reports, delving into various facets of the Zoe Empowers program that could benefit from improvements to enhance its overall success.
